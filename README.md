## CLI-based Day Planner

This is a Beta version and is still under development.

`timetable.txt` stores the timetable for each day.

`commands.txt` stores the commands and their shortcuts.

## Commands

* _setEvent_ : To set a new Event : `setEvent Name startTime EndTime`
* _quitCommand_ : To quit the program : `quit`
* _deleteEvent_ : Delete an event : `deleteCommand eventStartTime`
* displayCommand : display an event :  `displayCommand`
* _helpCommand_ : To get help. This command cannot be changed : `help`
* _changeCommandShortcut_: To change shortcut to a command : `changeCommand commandName shortcutName`

## Installation

As I said this application has not yet been finished. You will need to have python installed. If you dont have python installed have a look at [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). So to install it you will have to:

* Clone this repository onto your local machine
* Navigate to this repository in the terminal or command prompt
* run `python planIt.py`
